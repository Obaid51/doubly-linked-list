# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a doubly linked list. The doubly linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes from both the front and the back of the list. Each node in the list contains data and references to both the next and previous nodes, allowing for bi-directional traversal.

## Features

- **Add Elements**: You can add elements to both the front and the back of the list.
- **Remove Elements**: Remove elements based on their value. The list adjusts pointers automatically to maintain the list's integrity.
- **Traversal**: Bi-directional traversal from head to tail or tail to head.
- **Size Retrieval**: Quickly retrieve the current size of the list.
- **Print Elements**: Output the elements of the list in order from head to tail.
